     <p> You sat at each end of the flat-pack table, which he boasted he could set up and collapse within minutes.
He glanced at the photo that his mother gave him last Christmas. Your flimsy paper hats are frozen in film. The silver banded frame cuts into your smile and champagne glasses are held in the anticipation of a speech. He coughed, clearing his throat. Who would take Olly? He was hers. And the silver, the wedding album and the chocolate gateau at the back of the freezer?
 He followed a pea on his plate and stabbed it with the end of his fork. A green globe. It was kept from rest of the plate, safe in a sphere. Its shell became wedged between his front teeth.
You take him, you had begged, but he was insistent. I don’t like leaving you here alone. Don’t then, you had replied, but he was already packing away dinner into the dishwasher.
He left his suitcase open. It was meant to be for holidays. His shoes crept from summer to winter in autumnal fashion. By the end of the year, all of his shoes were in his case. Piece by piece, he packed away the bedroom.
